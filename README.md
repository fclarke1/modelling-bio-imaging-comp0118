UCL COMP0118: Computational Modelling for Biomedical Imaging

![Figure](https://github.com/fclarke1/modelling-bio-imaging-comp0118/blob/master/report/fig_T2_image_2_compartment_fitting.png)

Module from the Data Science and Machine Learning MSc, focusing on different aspects on computational modelling, in particular modelling using biomedical MRI images

The module lead upto the [final report](https://github.com/fclarke1/modelling-bio-imaging-comp0118/blob/master/report/submission/report_comp0118_22197823.pdf) which
pulled together all the different skills and methods learnt through the course to complete a self-directed individual analysis of full 3D head scans of over 100 individuals.
From these images the data was extracted, cleaned, analysed, and statistical modelling was completed on different populations within the dataset.

In the report 4 models were developed and compared, followed by bootstrap to estimate the distribution of our desired statistic.

See the [final report](https://github.com/fclarke1/modelling-bio-imaging-comp0118/blob/master/report/submission/report_comp0118_22197823.pdf) for more details
